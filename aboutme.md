# Alberto Roper Pol
## [Theoretical cosmologist]

I am currently a research group leader with an SNSF Ambizione grant at the [Geneva Cosmology group](https://cosmology.unige.ch/) at the University of Geneva — see [my profile](https://cosmology.unige.ch/users/alberto-roper-pol).

My research focuses on ***exploring the early Universe with gravitational waves and primordial magnetic fields***. I am the PI of the SNSF grant [208807](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/208807).

Before moving to Geneva in 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the theory group of the [Astroparticle and Cosmology Institute (APC)](https://apc.u-paris.fr/fr) in Paris.

I received my PhD from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2020, where I moved in 2015 with a [Balsells fellowship](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering-international/europe-colorado-program/student-profiles#accordion-346157704-1) to conduct my graduate studies. In Colorado, I was a researcher at the [Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics](https://lasp.colorado.edu/) and at the [Ann and H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences department](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/).
