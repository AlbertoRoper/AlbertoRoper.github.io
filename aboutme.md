# Alberto Roper Pol
## [Theoretical cosmologist]

I am currently a research group leader with an SNSF Ambizione grant at the [Geneva Cosmology group](https://cosmology.unige.ch/) at the University of Geneva — see [my profile](https://cosmology.unige.ch/users/alberto-roper-pol).

My research focuses on *exploring the early Universe with gravitational
waves and primordial magnetic fields*. I am the PI of the SNSF
grant [208807](Exploring the early universe with gravitational waves and primordial magnetic fields)


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
