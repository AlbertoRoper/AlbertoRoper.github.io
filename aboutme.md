My name is Alberto Roper Pol.
My research focuses on understanding the primordial Universe using gravitational waves and magnetic fields.
I am currently an SNSF Ambizione fellow at the [Geneva Cosmology group](https://cosmology.unige.ch/) at the University of Geneva, see (https://cosmology.unige.ch/users/alberto-roper-pol).

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
