# Alberto Roper Pol
## [Theoretical cosmologist]

I am currently a research group leader with an SNSF Ambizione grant at the [Geneva Cosmology group](https://cosmology.unige.ch/) at the University of Geneva — see [my profile](https://cosmology.unige.ch/users/alberto-roper-pol).

My research focuses on *understanding the primordial Universe using gravitational waves and magnetic fields*.


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
