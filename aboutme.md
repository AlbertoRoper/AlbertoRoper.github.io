# Alberto Roper Pol
## [Theoretical cosmologist]

I am currently a research group leader with an SNSF Ambizione grant at the [Geneva Cosmology group](https://cosmology.unige.ch/) at the University of Geneva — see [my profile](https://cosmology.unige.ch/users/alberto-roper-pol).

My research focuses on ***exploring the early Universe with gravitational
waves and primordial magnetic fields***. I am the PI of the SNSF
grant [208807](Exploring the early universe with gravitational waves and primordial magnetic fields).

You can find a short video about my SNSF Ambizione project from
