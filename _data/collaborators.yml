  bio: "The main area of interest for me in Theoretical Physics is High-Energy-Physics, in particular in relation with Early Universe Cosmology. I am currently focused on analytical studies and numerical simulations of the Gravitational Waves and Primordial Magnetic Fields produced from MHD turbulence and sound waves during a First-Order Phase Transition in the Early Universe."
