Last October I organized, together with my PhD student, Antonino Midiri, the 1st Pencil Code school on early Universe physics and gravitational waves (October 20-24, 2025) and the Pencil Code school user meeting (October 27-31, 2025) 2025. Information about the meeting and the school, the timetable and recordings are available on the [indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1548935/).

The school presented an overview of the [Pencil Code](https://pencil-code.nordita.org/) structure, on numerical methods to solve partial differential equations, on postprocessing and visualization using Python and IDL, on version control for collaborative projects using Git and SVN and on parallelization in multiple CPUs and acceleration on GPUs.

We also had a series of lectures on fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in the early Universe, primordial magnetic fields, chiral MHD, gravitational waves, inflation, and first-order phase transitions.

Together with lectures, we also had hands-on sessions with practical exercises using the Pencil Code, which had already been used in the course *“Simulations of Early Universe
Magnetohydrodynamics" that [Prof. Jennifer Schober](https://jennifer-schober.com/) co-lectured last year (May 2024) at EPFL as part of the Bernoulli program on [***cosmological magnetic fields***](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1334236/overview).

This school is a reflection of the growing interest and applicability of open-source Pencil Code to early Universe physics, which has attracted a growing interest since we developed the gravitational wave module on Pencil Code, which was part of my work during my PhD studies, together with Axel Brandenburg and collaborators.
