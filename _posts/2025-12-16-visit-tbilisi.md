I am visiting [Tina Kahniashvili](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/kahniashvili.html) at Ilia State University in Tbilisi, Georgia, for the week December 15-20. This is my second visit to Ilia State, the previous one being during my PhD in 2019 as a visiting researcher on a Georgian grant led by Tina.

During the visit, I am giving a seminar on "*Multi-messenger studies of primordial magnetic fields and gravitational waves*" on December 18.
