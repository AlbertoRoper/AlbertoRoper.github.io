For the occasion of the Pencil Code school and user meeting 2025, the researcher Alireza Talebian has visited our research group at the University of Geneva for the 2 weeks after the meeting (Nov. 3-14). Dr. Talebian is an expert on stochastic inflation and several aspects of magnetic field formation during inflation and has started working on several projects using the Pencil Code.

Alireza Talebian gave a seminar during our [journal club at the University of Geneva](https://agenda.unige.ch/events/view/44232) on 14/11/2025 on "*Dual Peaks in the Primordial Power Spectrum: Combining Gauge Field Instability and Ultra-Slow-Roll.*"

During the user meeting, Dr. Alireza Talebian used the Pencil Code user meeting logo to present the Mt Blanc Model on ultra-slow roll inflation!
