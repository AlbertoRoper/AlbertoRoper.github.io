It is our pleasure to have [Fumio Uchida](https://cf486016.cloudfree.jp/FUprofile.html) visiting the University of Geneva (Dec. 9-12 2025).

Dr. Uchida has worked on different aspects of primordial magnetogenesis and baryogenesis. He will give a seminar during our [journal club at the University of Geneva](https://agenda.unige.ch/events/view/44358) on 12/12/2025 on "*Primordial magnetic fields during the electroweak crossover and baryogenesis from magnetic helicity decay.*"
