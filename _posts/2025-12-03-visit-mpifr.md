I am visiting the new research group of Prof. [Jennifer Schober](https://jennifer-schober.com/) at the Argelander-Institute for Astronomy (AIfA) at the University of Bonn on December 4, 5.

During the visit, I will be giving the main colloquium at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR) on ["*Multi-messenger searches of primordial magnetic fields and gravitational waves*"](https://colloquia.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/) on December 5.
