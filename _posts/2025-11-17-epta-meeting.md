I am attending the [EPTA meeting](https://indico.sissa.it/event/168/overview) at the Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy, taking place on November 17-21, 2025.

I am honoured to have received a copy of the Royal Astronomy Society Group Award in Astronomy to the European Pulsar Timing Array. You can read about the awards [here](https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/news/pioneering-physicist-and-galaxy-luminary-among-2025-ras-award-winners).
