## Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions

Gravitational waves are produced during a first-order phase transition due to the collision of expanding bubbles of the symmetry-broken phase.
As they expand, these bubbles drag the expanding primordial plasma leading to the formation of fluid shells around them.
When these bubbles collide, they lead to the production of gravitational waves and can be a promising source for current pulsar timing array (PTA) observations and for the planned space-based detector LISA.
Both experiments can be used to probe the early Universe at the QCD and the electroweak scale, respectively.

The main sources of gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions:
- **Sound waves**: compressional fluid motion in the linearized regime (small fluid perturbations)
- **Turbulence**: compressional (acoustic turbulence) and vortical motion of the fluid perturbations in the linear regime
- **Bubble collisions**: gradients of the scalar field

### Gravitational waves from sound waves

The sound-shell model assumes that the fluid perturbations are a linearized superposition of sound waves produced from each of the bubbles after they have collided. This model allows to reproduce the gravitational wave signal for weak phase transitions when the fluid perturbations are small.

### Gravitational waves from phase transitions

Under the Higgsless approach, the fluid motion induced by the phase transitions can be studied by integrating out the dynamics of the scalar field, which occur within the bubble wall thickness, usually many orders of magnitude smaller than the fluid scales. This method allows to reduce the separation of scales between the fluid and the scalar field and capture most of the dynamics of the plasma in a first-order phase transition.
