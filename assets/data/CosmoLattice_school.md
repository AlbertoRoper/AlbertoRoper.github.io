The third edition of the [CosmoLattice school](https://indico.ific.uv.es/event/8110/overview) took place at IBS in Daejeon, from September 22 to 26, 2025. The lectures from the second edition of the school are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak54SUrjUss&list=PLoV52BoaZwsYVVW0jXd67SJXqQ2FN4EZd).

For the lectures on magnetohydrodynamics during the school, Antonino, Ken and I prepared a series of notes on plasma physics and MHD:
