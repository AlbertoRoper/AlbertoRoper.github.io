The main area of interest for me in Theoretical Physics is High-Energy-Physics, in particular
in relation with Early Universe Cosmology. I am currently focused on analytical studies and
numerical simulations of the Gravitational Waves and Primordial Magnetic Fields produced from
MHD turbulence and sound waves during a First-Order Phase Transition in the Early Universe.
