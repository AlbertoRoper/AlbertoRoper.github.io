### *Updated on November 11, 2025*

You can find an up-to-date list of my publications on my [inspire-hep profile](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1765001?ui-citation-summary=true), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UZAqaVMAAAAJ&hl=en) or at the [ADS/NASA database](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/86yARrb0TUqH9CmyyHEAvg).

I have given a total of 73 talks at international, workshops, seminars, and conferences, 25 of which were invited talks.

A nice perk of being a researcher is the possibility to visit many interesting places around the world!
You can find below a map of the places I have visited to give a talk or to attend a scientific meeting.
